# CONNECT FOUR

This is a simple connect four game played on terminal. Every player takes turns dropping discs into the board. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their discs consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

This project has been done while keeping it TDD. It helped me understand the concept of TDD and testing in general.
